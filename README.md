## About Me

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Khartoum, specializing in building and deploying end-to-end ML solutions across NLP, classification, and predictive modeling domains.

As a native Arabic speaker, I bring a particular focus to Arabic NLP — an area where I combine technical expertise with deep linguistic understanding to build models that serve Arabic-speaking communities and organizations across the region.

I am passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges in healthcare, cybersecurity, education, and digital wellbeing.
